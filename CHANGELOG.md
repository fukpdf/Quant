---

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-03

### Phase 11 — Multi-Agent Intelligence & Autonomous Strategy Factory

#### Added
- **Intelligence DB** (`intelligence-db.ts`) — persistence layer for all Phase 11 entities: strategy rankings, market regimes, portfolio allocations, optimization runs, optimization results, strategy generations, AI agent tasks, and research sessions.
- **Intelligence Types** (`intelligence-types.ts`) — shared TypeScript types for all Phase 11 subsystems: `RankingPeriod`, `RankingFactors`, `StrategyRankingResult`, `RegimeType`, `DetectedRegime`, `AllocationMethod`, `OptimizationConfig`, `Individual`, `Population`, and more.
- **Ranking Engine** (`ranking-engine.ts`) — multi-factor strategy ranking across 4 time periods (daily/weekly/monthly/all_time) using Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, drawdown, win rate, walk-forward consistency, and Monte Carlo scores; scores normalized to 0–100 with configurable RANKING_WEIGHTS.
- **Regime Detection Engine** (`regime-detection-engine.ts`) — market regime classifier (bull/bear/sideways/high_volatility/low_volatility) using 6-indicator ensemble: linear regression slope, annualized volatility, ADX proxy, average RSI, volume ratio, net return. Persists regime transitions with confidence scores and auto-closes stale regimes.
- **Portfolio Allocator** (`portfolio-allocator.ts`) — 4 allocation methods: `equal_weight`, `risk_parity`, `mean_variance`, `momentum_tilt`. Respects min/max weight constraints per strategy, merges performance-based momentum overlays, and persists full allocation history.
- **Genetic Evolution Engine** (`genetic-evolution-engine.ts`) — genetic algorithm for strategy parameter optimization: tournament selection with elitism, single-point and arithmetic crossover, Gaussian/uniform/boundary/creep mutation; 5 fitness objectives (Sharpe, Calmar, total_return, Sortino, profit_factor); persists each generation to DB.
- **Strategy Optimizer** (`strategy-optimizer.ts`) — 4 optimization methods: `grid_search`, `random_search`, `bayesian` (Gaussian process with expected improvement), `genetic` (delegates to GeneticEvolutionEngine); persists full optimization run history with best parameter set.
- **AI Optimization Assistant** (`ai-optimization-assistant.ts`) — LLM-powered natural language interface for strategy analysis; generates optimization suggestions, interprets results, builds strategy performance summaries from DB backtest records.
- **Continuous Learning Engine** (`continuous-learning-engine.ts`) — regime-aware performance monitoring; detects strategy degradation (Sharpe drop, drawdown spike, win rate collapse); triggers re-optimization recommendations; persists learning events and adaptation history.
- **Intelligence Correlation Engine** (`intelligence-correlation-engine.ts`) — strategy clustering by parameter-space and performance-space proximity; computes pairwise correlation matrices; groups strategies into diversified clusters to reduce portfolio concentration.
- **Research Coordinator** (`research-coordinator.ts`) — orchestrates multi-step research sessions: regime detection → strategy ranking → portfolio allocation → optimization recommendations; persists research session audit trail.
- **Intelligence Scheduler** (`intelligence-scheduler.ts`) — Phase 11 background scheduler with 5 configurable loops: regime detection (60 min), strategy ranking (6 hr), correlation clustering (12 hr), research coordination (30 min), continuous learning (2 hr).
- **Intelligence Routes** (`routes/v1/intelligence-routes.ts`) — 17 REST endpoints under `/api/v1/intelligence/*`: rankings, regimes, allocations, optimization runs, optimization results, strategy generations, AI agent tasks, research sessions; full CRUD + trigger endpoints.
- **11 new DB schema tables**: `strategy_rankings`, `market_regimes`, `portfolio_allocations`, `allocation_history`, `strategy_clusters`, `strategy_correlations`, `optimization_runs`, `optimization_results`, `strategy_generations`, `ai_agent_tasks`, `research_sessions`.
- **OpenAPI spec v0.11.0** — intelligence paths and schemas added; codegen regenerated.

#### Architecture
- All Phase 11 services are advisory-only — no live capital, no order placement
- Genetic algorithm fills-at-open (N+1) using the existing Phase 4 backtest engine
- Column naming: `totalTrades` (not `tradeCount`), `consistencyScore` (not `efficiencyRatio`), `medianReturn` (not `medianFinalEquity`); `BacktestRequest` uses `interval` + `params`
- `@workspace/db` import (not `@workspace/db/client`) — the `/client` subpath is not exported

---

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-03

- **execution-state-machine.ts** (ADR-026) — strict state transition enforcement; illegal transitions throw immediately; every transition recorded to `execution_order_events`
- **execution-pre-trade-pipeline.ts** (ADR-027) — four-stage pre-trade gate: schema validation → risk snapshot check (Phase 6 engine) → kill-switch check → circuit-breaker check; rejects with stage tag recorded to `execution_rejections`
- **MockExecutionProvider** — instant-fill simulation; fills at last known market price ± 0–5 bps random slippage; no API key required; default for `EXECUTION_MODE=simulation`
- **PaperExecutionProvider** — realistic fills using Phase 9 `MarketStateEngine`; mid-price ± half-spread with order-type appropriate slippage; uses VWAP for large orders
- **execution-router.ts** (ADR-028) — mode-aware provider selection; health-checks providers on boot; returns `live_disabled` provider stub if mode is `live_disabled`; tracks per-provider latency
- **execution-oms.ts** — master OMS orchestrator; `submitOrder()` runs full pipeline in one call: pre-trade → route → provider.submit → fill engine → position engine → audit log → event bus publish
- **execution-fill-engine.ts** (ADR-029) — fill processing with commission (0.1% maker/taker), slippage in bps, and `ExecutionFill` DB write; publishes `FillReceived` event
- **execution-position-engine.ts** (ADR-030) — position open/update/close with average-cost basis, unrealized/realized P&L, mark-to-market updates; publishes `PositionUpdated` event
- **execution-monitor.ts** (ADR-031) — stale order detection (5min threshold), stuck order auto-fail (30min threshold), MTM refresh every 60s

- **execution-recovery-service.ts** (ADR-033) — lost ACK detection (30s), lost fill detection (5min), recovery timeout handler (10min); automated cancel-on-timeout in simulation mode
- **execution-scheduler.ts** — master startup; validates `EXECUTION_MODE`; refuses to start on invalid mode; upserts default account; creates session record; starts monitor + analytics + recovery
- **13 new REST endpoints** under `execution` tag:
  - `POST /v1/execution/orders` — full-pipeline order submission
  - `GET /v1/execution/orders` — list with status/symbol/mode filters
  - `GET /v1/execution/orders/:id` — detail + full event history

- **OpenAPI spec v0.10.0** — 13 new paths, 15 new component schemas, `execution` tag

#### Safety Guarantees
- `EXECUTION_MODE=live` is not a valid value — scheduler refuses to start (throws)
- `live_disabled` mode starts the OMS but blocks all orders at provider level
- No real-money API keys in codebase or environment templates
- Kill-switch state (`getKillSwitchStatus()`) checked synchronously in pre-trade pipeline
